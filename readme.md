Underneath
==========

An ascii based RPG lightly based on the classic game Rogue
----------------------------------------------------------

### Written in c++.

This program uses standard c++ libraries and ncurses (pdcurses in Windows).

---

Optimised for OSX, works well in Linux, works okay in Windows.


In Windows' Command Promt only 8 colors work so it doesn't look quite as nice.
