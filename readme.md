# Underneath

A dungeon crawler with old-school style ASCII graphics.


### Written in c++11

This program uses standard c++ libraries.  
The terminal graphics version uses ncurses (pdcurses on windows).  
The SDL2 graphics version uses SDL2 and SDL2_Image libraries. (use the -s flag during compile)

My development is primarily in MacOSX. I have successfully compiled for Windows using MinGW on Linux and Mac. Good luck compiling locally on Windows, I haven't successfully done that in a while (although I am not very well versed in windows development).

## build.py

I made a compile script with python, I originally used GNU MAKE, but I'm not well versed with that and I kept running into issues so I moved to a langueage I have a little more experience using. The script is not nessisary to use as the dependencies are very simple, so feel free to use a compiler directly.
