### Written in c++ 11

This program uses standard c++ libraries and ncurses (pdcurses in Windows).

Requires C++ 11

Works in Mac OSX Intel 64bit clang and g++
Works in Linux Intel 64bit g++
Works in Windows (largly untested, and only 8 colors work in command prompt).

Other configurations should work but I haven't tested much.
